tilegame
========

This is a tile game with a twist - different sizes of the pices. The goal of this game is to move the biggest block through the exit on the bottom, with as few movement as possible. Use the arrow keys to move the cursor, enter to select a block and enter to release again.  This code is mainly just to demonstrate structured javascript programming.
